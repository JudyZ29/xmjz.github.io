My name is Xinmu (Judy) Zhang (张馨木). I am a high-temperature isotope geochemist and cosmochemist in training. I study the evolution processes of Earth and planetary feedstocks as well as the origins of life-supporting volatiles (e.g., water). 

I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences at [Washington University in St. Louis (WashU)](https://eeps.wustl.edu/). I am also a [McDonnell Center for the Space Sciences](https://mcss.wustl.edu/) Graduate Fellow.

Previously, I earned my B.A. in Earth and Planetary Sciences (Geochemistry) from WashU in December 2021 and M.S. in Geosciences from Scripps Institution of Oceanography (UC San Diego) in June 2023.

My research interests are:
======
- How were compositional heterogenties in the present-day terrestrial mantle generated and preserved through accretion and long-term material transport between the deep Earth and surface reservoirs? 
Example: [(Zhang et al. 2024 EPSL)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2024.118591)

- How did the compositions of the terrestrial atmosphere, continental crust, and mantle evolve together over Earth's history? 
Example: [(Zhang et al. 2023 EPSL)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2023.118083)

- How do we obtain early snapshots of planetary evolution processes? How did partial melting/metal-silicate differentiation look like in early Solar System planetary feedstocks? 
Example: [(Zhang et al. 2025 GCA)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2025.11.014)
